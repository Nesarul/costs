Costs.ai

For now, I want to change it to no longer use any sub pages. This will make things a lot easier, and the subpages currently don't really show any useful info anyhow. No we no longer need dynamically generated urls.

Keep a copy of how we have it now in case I want to change it later to use subpages again

Here's the changes that are needed:

1.  The main search API now requires a start and end parameter or it won't work. You can use this for the "More Results" button. It is like 
http://51.68.206.144:8002/dogs?start=1&end=24

2. You can use this image for the NFT collections with no image: http://www.clker.com/clipart-no-image-available-1.html

3. Under the search box on the main page at https://costs.ai add this centered text similar to how I have text under the search box at https://topdatasets.com :
Searching Millions of NFTs on 10 Different Blockchains

4. In case you need it, the list of networks/blockchains from my API is:
"ethereum-mainnet",
"solana-mainnet",
"arbitrum-mainnet",
"avalanche-mainnet",
"bsc-mainnet",
"celo-mainnet",
"fantom-mainnet",
"harmony-mainnet",
"optimism-mainnet",
"polygon-mainnet"


5.  You have this incorrect:
"If blockchain is etheruem-mainnet show it as Ethereum"
You have it as "Etheruem"  (it is spelled wrong)

This still needs to be done:
-----------------------
5. After I do a search it takes me to https://costs.ai/index.php
but it should take me to https://costs.ai
------------------------

6. Instead of linking each result to a subpage, link instead to the marketplace URL for each NFT collection. 
This marketplace URL is not in my API, you will need to create it.  It is based on the network/blockchain name.

For Ethereum and Polygon, it uses the the "name" field like if
name  "CondoMiniNeighborhood"  then the marketplace url would be
https://opensea.io/assets?search\[query]=CondoMiniNeighborhood

For Solana it uses the "symbol" field like
symbol  "okay_bears"   then the marketplace url would be
https://magiceden.io/marketplace/okay_bears

For these 2 networks/blockchains it uses the NFT collection name like:
Arbitrum:   https://stratosnft.io/search?query=collectionname
BSC: https://www.binance.com/en/nft/search-result?keyword=collectionname

For these, the marketplaces do not have a way for me to link to a specific search string, so instead just link to the main url of each marketplace:
Avalanche: https://joepegs.com
Celo: https://cyberbox.art
Fantom: https://paintswap.finance
Harmony:  https://madnfts.io
Optimism: https://qx.app/

======================================

Next, I want to add 3 more pages to BoredHumans.com, similar to text-to-speech. But instead of text, each of these involves use the user uploading a media file instead.
Also, none of these need a bad words filter, but they all do need the IP address limiting system.

Attached is speech-to-text.php which is to use to get started with the speech-to-text page. You will need to have a form to allow the user to upload a file instead of typing text. Once you finish it, use that as a template to create the other 2 sites, as those both have file uploads also. Use POST for the form to my API.

The biggest problem with these 3 new pages is you need to create a system for allowing users to upload the files. It is too complicated (and takes too long) to pass the actual media file to my remote API (which then would need to pass it again to the source API I use), so instead I want to upload all the photos to https://boredhumans.com/uploads/ 
You can then pass the url for it (like https://boredhumans.com/uploads/eric.jpg) to my API.
Also, after you get a result URL back from my API, automatically delete the source image from my server.

Like with text-to-image, I had my programmer create an API for each of these 3 sites.

The 3 sites are:

A) Speech-To-Text (creates a transcript of an audio file). It accepts FLAC, WAV, or MP3 files.
See demo at https://replicate.com/openai/whisper
My API is:
POST http://51.68.206.144:8010/whisper
Body should be like this :
{
Â "file":"https://boredhumans.com/transcripts/audiofiles/videoplayback.mp3"
}

It will ouput a lot of info but all I want is the text, which is like this:  results.json['transcription']


B) StyleClip (you upload a photo and can change the hair color and other things)
See demo at https://replicate.com/orpatashnik/styleclip
My API is: 
POST http://51.68.206.144:8011/styleclip
{
 "file":"https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/GettyImages-1092658864_hero-1024x575.jpg",
 "target": "a face with bald head"
}

The "target" is what you want to change the photo to. The ouptut will be an image url like with text-to-image.


C) Age Progression (you upload a photo and it shows what you look like younger or older) - https://replicate.com/yuval-alaluf/sam#run
See demo at https://replicate.com/yuval-alaluf/sam#run
My API is:
POST http://51.68.206.144:8012/age
{
 "file":"https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/GettyImages-1092658864_hero-1024x575.jpg",
 "age": 80
}

The ouptut will be an image url like with text-to-image.
